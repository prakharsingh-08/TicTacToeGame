A Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a classic two-player board game that involves a 3x3 grid. The game's objective is for players to take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O," with the goal of forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols before their opponent does. The game starts with an empty grid, and players click on a cell to place their symbol. JavaScript handles the game's logic, checking for a winner after each move and determining if the game ends in a win, a draw, or continues. CSS provides the styling and layout, making it visually appealing and easy to interact with on a web page. Overall, this simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game offers a fun and engaging way for two players to challenge each other's strategic thinking and reflexes.
